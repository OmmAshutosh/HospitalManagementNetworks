# HospitalManagementNetworks
ðŸš‘ Hospital Network Infrastructure Project
This project addresses critical challenges in hospital IT infrastructureâ€”focusing on data security, network reliability, and scalabilityâ€”through the integration of modern technologies such as VLAN segmentation, OSPF routing, Cisco ASA firewalls, and Wi-Fi 6. The goal is to create a secure, future-ready network that supports EMRs, telemedicine, and IoT-enabled healthcare.

The result is a scalable and replicable network blueprint that enhances real-time communication, protects sensitive patient data, and improves overall operational efficiency. It serves as a model for hospitals moving toward digital transformation.
